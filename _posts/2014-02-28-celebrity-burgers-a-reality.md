Back in September last year, [I explored some possibilities that the &#8220;Stem Cell burger&#8221; opened up.](http://bradfordcondon.wordpress.com/2013/09/14/ethical-implications-of-the-stem-cell-burger/)  Perhaps the most far-fetched idea I had was to produce meat from cloned celebrity stem cells.

It seems this idea wasn&#8217;t as absurd as I thought.  A new company has launched called [Bitelabs](http://bitelabs.org/), claiming they will produce celebrity-derived meats in salami-form.<figure style="width: 487px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

[<img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-309" alt="Image" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bradfordcondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-28-at-12-48-52-pm.png?resize=487%2C157" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://i0.wp.com/www.bradfordcondon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-28-at-12-48-52-pm.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Always push the boundaries in taste</figcaption></figure> 

So is it a hoax or a real company?  The [internet isn&#8217;t quite sure what to make of it.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/02/26/bite_labs_is_probably_a_prank_artisanal_salami_from_celebrity_tissue_samples.html)  My previous post covered the feasibility of such an endeavor, but the ethics remains a gray zone. In the meantime, I fully support the discussion, and I applaud Bitelabs&#8217; understated strategy.  Personally I&#8217;d be interested in trying a cloned meat product, regardless of who the donor was.
