Back in September last year, [I explored some possibilities that the &#8220;Stem Cell burger&#8221; opened up.](/2013/09/14/ethical-implications-of-the-stem-cell-burger/)  Perhaps the most far-fetched idea I had was to produce meat from cloned celebrity stem cells.

It seems this idea wasn&#8217;t as absurd as I thought.  A new company has launched called [Bitelabs](http://bitelabs.org/), claiming they will produce celebrity-derived meats in salami-form.<figure style="width: 487px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

So is it a hoax or a real company?  The [internet isn&#8217;t quite sure what to make of it.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/02/26/bite_labs_is_probably_a_prank_artisanal_salami_from_celebrity_tissue_samples.html)  My previous post covered the feasibility of such an endeavor, but the ethics remains a gray zone. In the meantime, I fully support the discussion, and I applaud Bitelabs&#8217; understated strategy.  Personally I&#8217;d be interested in trying a cloned meat product, regardless of who the donor was.
