[I previously announced a Workshop we hosted at Floracliff on mushroom identification In October 2016](http://www.bradfordcondon.com/fun/science/2016/08/25/upcoming-workshop-mushrooms-101-at-floracliff-nature-conservatory/).  It's been a while but I wanted to share a little bit about the experience and post materials.

First of all, a big thank you to Beverly and Josie at Floracliff.  It was a joy working with you all.  Same goes to our wonderful participants, we couldn't have asked for a better audience.

I'm sharing photos from the workshop and material below. Special thanks to [Kevin Lutes](https://www.instagram.com/klutesphoto/) for taking professional photographs and for permission to link them here.

Hope to see you all again soon!
