[Phyloseq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/) is a fantastic R package that really helped me get started in R.  If you need to process your metagenomic data but lack the experience in statistics/R to use, say, the ecology stats R package [VEGAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/vegan.pdf), I highly recommend giving Phyloseq a try.  Running through the vignettes will produce great heatmaps, taxonomy plots, and PCA/NMDS plots.

As I became more comfortable in R, I found myself relying on Phyloseq less and using the VEGAN packages Phyloseq was wrapping more.  Still, Phyloseq is a fantastic stepping stone for scientists studying metagenomics who are not ecologists themselves.

I&#8217;ll be posting some solutions to problems I&#8217;ve encountered working with my own data over the next few months.
