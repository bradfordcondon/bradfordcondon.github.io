Early this year, I joined Meg Staton's group at the University of Tennessee as a mobile and web developer.  My major project since then has been designing, coding, and releasing the mobile citizen science app TreeSnap.  I think it's a fantastic project, and I'd love it if you [visited the app's website](https://treesnap.org) to learn more.

# What is TreeSnap?

 In short, the app aims to connect tree lovers and scientists by asking citizens to report "survivor" tree species threatened by pests and disease.  Users answer a few question, snap a few pictures, and the app sends the information, along with GPS coordinates, to [the TreeSnap server](https://treesnap.org/map).  There, scientists who study disease resistance or run tree breeding programs can use the collected data for their research, or follow up and collect tissue/pollen/seed for their research!

# TreeSnap in the news

I'm grateful to Carol Spence for interviewing Dr. Ellen Crocker (the extension specialist on TreeSnap) and myself about TreeSnap.  The original article was published in [UK Ag News](http://news.ca.uky.edu/article/new-tree-app-builds-partnerships-between-citizens-and-scientists#.WW-idVr9wng.twitter) on July 18th 2017.

The story has since appeared in:
