Meeting with Jonathan


### Summary

CAI are higher than random for control genes.  This is good/as expected.

CAI are no higher htan random for tox genes.  This is reasonable.

CAI is higher when genes using Lingdomyces CUT to calculate CAI.  This is interesting and will be investigated.

####  To do:

* Summary table with calculated CAI for each gene, the SD, the threshold.   (99 %) ?
	- automating this expecting we're goign to change the input and perhaps output.

* Test all TOX and controls genes using native CUT AND using Ligndomyces CUT
	- What about the threshhold from randomly generated CAI?	

* Jon will ask Bradford for coding help! And working in the shared directory so he can help :D

	
* Examine individual effect of tox genes on the average tox CAI being higher using lingdo CUT vs native.

* Generate CUTs using control AND tox genes for eall species.  And we're going to calculate pairwise distances.
