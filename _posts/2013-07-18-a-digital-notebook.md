When I first started graduate school, I kept an old-fashioned notebook.  A 4&#215;4 quad ruled Roaring Spring Lab Notebook.<figure style="width: 253px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

<img alt="" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.rspaperproducts.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/product_large/product_images/77649.jpg?resize=253%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">My first carbon paper lab notebook</figcaption></figure> 

It had gridlines, it had carbon paper (The carbon sheets remain, unperturbed, at the back of the notebook), it had Thomas Edison on the cover scienceing it up.  It was everything I thought science would and should be.

As a tool for keeping track of what I did for later reference, however,it was a complete disaster.

I&#8217;m not an organized person by nature.  I work in spurts, I don&#8217;t keep careful track of what I&#8217;m doing.  I often have to go back and fill in the details.  This means writeups I would intend to return to later were buried under experiments I would go ahead with in the meantime.

I also am not a linear person (or perhaps science is not a linear endeavor).  One day I would work on project X, the next, project Y.  Science works that way, sometimes, project X needs a week to grow, sometimes project Y sits in the fridge while the primers are synthesized and delivered in the mail.

Both of these traits make for a messy, and extremely confusing lab notebook.  Sure, I could have kept one notebook for each project I was working on.  But what about when I&#8217;d perform an experiment that fit into two projects?  Sometimes I will perform an assay using two sets of mutants, for two separate reasons.  Would I double-copy the experiment?  Perhaps this is when I should have actually used that carbon paper.

No, instead, I switched to a standard 3-ring binder after my first year in graduate school.  I could re-define the boundaries of a given project easily, add and remove page dividers for each project, and easily add in printed pages.

Looking back on my research project (and looking forward to where I may be next), I think if I could do it again, I would keep a digital notebook first and foremost.  I did keep a digital notebook, using the [app Mori.](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/10868/mori)  Unfortunately, development on Mori ceased long ago, and I used it exclusively for digital notes.

No, I think the ideal thing to do would be to keep a purely digital notebook, with printed backups of results and summaries in a three-ring notebook.

A digital notebook is searchable.  It doesn&#8217;t have to be linear.  I can look for all projects with a given gene or technique, and pull them all out.  A good notebook is tagable (and hopefully well tagged.)  I don&#8217;t have to decide if an experiment goes in notebook A or notebook B.  It just gets tagged AB, and goes into the digital notebook.

I also don&#8217;t have to wait until my results are processed to add them to the notebook.  This is a big one.  Raw unprocessed data files (such as .nexml tree files that are a finished product, but need to be visualized, or microscopy experiments that take a fair amount of post processing effort) go right in the notebook.<figure id="attachment_158" style="width: 251px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Scanning in the above sheet, for example, lets me find it no matter what project I&#8217;m working on in the future, rather than digging through years of failed and succesful experiments in different notebooks when writing my materials and methods later.  Note that I added a minimal number of tags, but wrote out the key media ingredients (different forms of iron) for search purposes.

I&#8217;ll talk more about the best way to organize a digital notebook and tips for making the most of it (for example, sharing and compiling status updates for the boss).
