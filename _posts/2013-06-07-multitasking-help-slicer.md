Sometimes it&#8217;s the little things that make a big difference.

[Slicer](http://slicerapp.com/) is a tiny app.  Its sole function is to reduce the active screen window to 50%, 33%, or 66% of the screen height.

What do I use Slicer for?  When I&#8217;m copying data from a figure or excel file into a text writeup.  When I&#8217;m browsing the internet and taking notes at the same time.    Reorganizing data folder structures, dragging from one window to another. Anytime I&#8217;m multitasking.   Or half-tasking (procrastinating and working at the same).  And when am I not doing one of those two things?<figure id="attachment_95" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

>Slicer makes hopping between apps, and working with multiple apps at the same time, so much easier.

This blog is really about ways to be a better scientist; efficient use of technology is one of them.  Slicer is one of those apps that I can&#8217;t believe I rely on so heavily- was it  so bad to drag and resize manually?  All I can say, working in a post-Slicer environment, where all of my windows fit into one of my designated work zones perfectly, I could never go back to my primitive ways.
