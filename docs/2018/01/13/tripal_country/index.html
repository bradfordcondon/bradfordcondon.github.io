<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Travels in Tripal country.</p>

<p>I am not a developer by training, originally.  I am a geneticist.  I recognize the boundaries of my expertise.  I am not the world’s foremost expert on Drupal, or Tripal, or database programming.</p>

<p>I am, however, a man who has spent the past year learning Tripal 3.</p>

<p>Rather than presume to write the guide on Tripal (which I am not skilled enough to do), I would like to share my travel notes with you as I explore the new features and paradigms of Tripal 3.</p>

<h1 id="the-basics">The basics</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Drupal</li>
  <li>Tripal</li>
  <li>CHADO</li>
  <li>Classes in PHP</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-entity">The Entity</h1>

<p>A critical shift in Drupal 8 is the conversion of entities to nodes.  Tripal Prepares for the Drupal 8 conversion by changing Tripal <strong>nodes</strong> to Tripal Entities.</p>

<p>You can learn more about Drupal entities <a href="">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="entities-vs-nodes">Entities vs nodes</h3>

<p>One of the fundamental changes between Tripal 2 and Tripal 3 is the entity.</p>

<p>In ye olde days of Tripal 2 development, content was based around nodes.  Every base table in table corresponded to a node type: Analysis, Organism, Feature, Map, etc.  Some Chado tables could map to multiple nodes: which node would depend on either a column in the Chado table (such as the type column in feature [TODO DOUBLE CHECK THAT]) or on a property in the linker table (such as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">analysis_type</code> property in the analysisprop table, describing an analysis).</p>

<p>The TripalEntity… changes none of that.  An entity maps to a Chado table just like a node does.  Multiple entity types can map to the same Chado table using a type column or a prop.</p>

<p>What entities do allow is more site administrator control of how entities look on the site.  Inserting data into the database and creating the content type is easier, too.  Before, you had to hook into node create, edit, and delete for each content type.  Now, bulk loading of data is handled by extending the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TripalLoader</code> class.  I personally love this class: you gain access to a user-friendly file uploader, as well as database transactions, for free.  If you’re converting old code, the actual Drupal can remain more or less unchanged.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking in terms of Chado, then you can learn that all entities are actually the same type, <code class="highlighter-rouge">TripalEntity</code>, and then promptly forget it.</p>

<h4 id="simplified">Simplified</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Before, nodes handled loading your data into Chado or database of choice, editing, deleting, as well as viewing the content.</li>
  <li>Bundles and fields distribute that job.</li>
  <li>TripalLoader handles bulk-loading data. Bundles handle creation of single entities.</li>
  <li>Bundles are just aggregates of fields.</li>
  <li>Rather than doing everything, the bundle delegates the creation, editing, and display of each individual piece of data to a field.</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important thing I can tell you is this: before you create a field, make sure</p>
<ul>
  <li>the field doesn’t already exist</li>
  <li>the field you want wouldn’t better be handled by a Chado property</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-are-bundles-and-fields">What are bundles and fields?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A bundle is a collection of fields.</li>
  <li>A bundle defines a particular entity type.
SOME MORE DEFINITIONS.</li>
</ul>

<p>When defining a bundle, you’ll want to write a field for <strong>each column</strong> of the Chado base table that doesn’t already exist. I’ll write about fields in-depth in another post, but for now, please consider using the Tripal Fields Generator written by myself and Abdullah Almsaeed.  I spent my first couple of days hacking through the Tripal jungle going in circles because of typos and inconsistencies in my Fields files: the Field Generator tool will fill everything out for you.</p>

<h3 id="web-services">Web services</h3>

<p>It’s worth noting that Tripal 3 also provides <strong>web services</strong> for entities.  Because entities and their fields are strongly typed, the site can be browsed by a computer traversing linked entities (essentially JSON).  In the future when databases are more interconnected, and computers are able to more intelligently mine data from sites, Tripal databases will be ready to share and describe all of their data.</p>

<h1 id="fields">Fields</h1>

<p>How to create a field:</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-gui">What about the GUI?</h2>

<p>The GUI for field generation is quite good, and for something basic you may not need to code your field at all.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-appropriate-cvterm-for-my-field">What is an appropriate CVterm for my field?</h2>

<p>Start with the EBI Ontology Lookup Service.  Don’t rush this step.  If you’re really stuck, post on the Tripal Github or Slack and the community will help weigh in.  It’s easy to take shortcuts as this step, but properly termed fields will result in <strong>more web accessible</strong> websites that can <strong>share and connect easily</strong>.  If everyone uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">local</code> terms, or different obscure terms, to describe the same thing, then we lose the benefits of web services.</p>

<h2 id="where-is-the-data-for-this-field-stored">Where is the data for this field stored?</h2>

<h3 id="the-chado-base-table">The chado base table</h3>

<h3 id="the-property-table">The property table</h3>

<p>If the answer is the props table, stop writing your field.  Use the GUI.  If you want to hardcode your field as a props, you actually don’t need to do anything except add the property to a record.  If there is a record with the property and you press the <code class="highlighter-rouge">check for new fields</code> button, the property will magically show up as a field.</p>

<h3 id="a-linker-table">A linker table</h3>

<p>Writing a good linker field is hard and probably beyond me.  You can see an example linker table I wrote <strong>here</strong>: it’s not very flexible and only designed to link two bundles.  Tripal comes with a few linker table fields that are much more flexible, and I recommend looking at these examples to code in their footsteps rather than my own.</p>

<h3 id="somewhere-else">Somewhere else</h3>

<p>Shrug?  If it’s something basic like a text description, it goes in… (some table i dont know about?)</p>

<p>If its something more involved… let me ask, why can’t it fit in Chado?
Maybe your module needs to define a new Chado schema and store it in a new table.  Maybe an existing module already created the table you need, or a table can be re-purposed for your needs.  While adding new tables to Chado isn’t something you should do lightly, it’s also something you should do if Chado can’t hold the biological data you need!</p>

<h2 id="fields-anatomy-of-a-field">Fields: anatomy of a field</h2>

<p>Every column that is exposed to the user in a Chado table needs a field.
Additionally, every piece of information that you want served to users when visiting an entities’ page needs a field.  How the field is displayed to your users is handled by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">field_formatter</code>.  The site administrator can customize the grouping and layout of fields, which I’ll talk about in another section.</p>

<h3 id="quickstart-defining-a-field">Quickstart: defining a field</h3>

<ul>
  <li>pick a CVTerm.  Make sure you’ve got the accession, DB, and CV values straight.</li>
  <li>Create the field file trinity of <code class="highlighter-rouge">local__fake_field.inc</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">local__fake_field_formatter.inc</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">local__fake_field_widget.inc</code></li>
  <li>Declare &amp; attach your field in your modules <code class="highlighter-rouge">fields.inc</code></li>
  <li>Clear your cache.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">drush cc all</code>.</li>
  <li>Enable your field in the target bundle at <code class="highlighter-rouge">admin-&gt;structure-&gt;Tripal content types</code>.</li>
  <li>Check for new fields by clicking the big blue <strong>+ Add new fields</strong> link in the upper left.  If all went well, you should see a message that your field was added.  If not, check your code, clear your cache, and try again.</li>
  <li>Your field is <em>disabled</em> by default.  To enable it, click on</li>
</ul>

<p>You can’t clear your cache too often when working with fields.  Well, you can, because clearing the cache and then rebuilding the site is quite slow.  But if you’re getting frustrated, keep calm and clear your cache.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">drush cc all</code>.</p>

<h3 id="background-summary">Background Summary</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Like Bundles, each Field must be uniquely associated with a CVterm.</li>
  <li>Fields for your module live in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/includes/TripalFields</code></li>
  <li>Individual fields can be added to your sites library folder, if the libraries module is enabled.  Fields can then live in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/sites/all/libraries/TripalFields</code> but I haven’t gotten this working yet.</li>
  <li>Your module declares and attaches fields to Bundles in your module’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">fields.inc</code> file, located in <code class="highlighter-rouge">includes/[module_name]_fields.inc</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="field-files">Field Files</h3>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">local__fake_field.inc</code></li>
  <li>Sets default values for the field, like the label and description.  Declares the formatter and widget to use.  Sets the <em>instance settings</em> which declare where the field’s data is stored.</li>
  <li>The critical method is <code class="highlighter-rouge">load($entity)</code>.  The entity refers to the <em>bundle</em>, and tells the field how to load data for this entity.  So the <code class="highlighter-rouge">species name</code> field, when attached to organism, looks in the appropriate column in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">organism</code> table for the given entity by looking up its <code class="highlighter-rouge">record_id</code>.</li>
  <li>Load doesn’t need to return anything, it should set <code class="highlighter-rouge">$entity-&gt;{$field}['und'][0]</code> with a value.  This value also is held by web services! If the field should be empty, set this to null.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">local__fake_field_formatter.inc</code></li>
  <li>Formats the field value for display.  Optional.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">local__fake_field_widget.inc</code></li>
  <li>provides an input widget when manually creating a bundle where the field is attached.  Optional.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can make a general formatter that gets used directly by multiple fields, or that is extended by other formatters.</p>

<h3 id="telling-tripal-about-your-field">Telling Tripal about your field</h3>
<p>Once your field is coded, (or realistically, once you’ve created your blank stub that does nothing), you are ready to tell Tripal about your field.  This happens in two places in your module’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">fields.inc</code> file.</p>

<h4 id="tripal_biomaterial_bundle_fields_info"><code class="highlighter-rouge">tripal_biomaterial_bundle_fields_info()</code></h4>
<p>This method implements <code class="highlighter-rouge">hook_bundle_fields_info</code>.  In the below code you’ll see that the implementation of this hook means a) checking if the field is appropriate for the bundle by looking at <code class="highlighter-rouge">$bundle-&gt;data_table</code>, which is the bundle’s Chado base table b)inserting the CVterm used by the field, and c) setting the field storage settings.  Make sure you return your <code class="highlighter-rouge">$fields</code> array.</p>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Because we’re talking about chado fields, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$fields</code> array will always follow the above form, with the name changing with the field.  You might want to change the cardinality if it makes sense for your field to hold multiple values for a single entity, or to <code class="highlighter-rouge">locked</code> if it doesn’t make sense for users to mess with your field.</p>

<h4 id="tripal_biomaterial_bundle_instances_infoentity_type-bundle"><code class="highlighter-rouge">tripal_biomaterial_bundle_instances_info($entity_type, $bundle)</code></h4>

<p>The previous hook told <em>bundle types</em> about your field: this hook will tell <em>bundle instances</em> about it.  Other than that I haven’t used it for anything fancy beyond the below example code.  Make sure you remember to return your <code class="highlighter-rouge">$instances</code> array.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>function tripal_biomaterial_bundle_instances_info($entity_type, $bundle) {

</div>

<h3 id="attaching-a-field-to-multiple-bundles">Attaching a field to multiple bundles</h3>

<p>You’ll notice that many of the default Tripal fields can attach to multiple bundles.  What magic is that?  To perform the same feat, you must code your field to be bundle agnostic, or at least bundle-flexible.</p>
