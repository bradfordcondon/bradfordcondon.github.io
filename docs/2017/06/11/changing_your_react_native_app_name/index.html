<p>In theory, all you need to do is rename the app in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> file and run <code class="highlighter-rouge">react-native upgrade</code>.</p>

<p>In practice, however, I’ve been getting the error: <code class="highlighter-rouge">A valid version number for 'react-native' is not specified in your 'package.json' file. Aborting.</code></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>react-native-cli: 2.0.1
react-native: 0.42.3
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Make sure that react and react-native are pointing to a stable release, for example,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> "react": "^15.4.*",
    "react-native": "^0.42.*",
    ```


It also suggests using the git upgrader, at `npm install -g react-native-git-upgrade`.  Once the upgrader is installed, run `sudo react-native-git-upgrade`.


You should also be sure to run a find-replace to replace your old app name with the new one in all text throughout the app itself.



### Removing the old app

* Manually delete all of the build specific folders and files in the `ios` and `android` folder.

* Now delete all modules, install, and re-link

</code></pre>
</div>
<p>sudo rm -rf node_modules &amp;&amp; sudo npm install &amp;&amp; react-native link</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>
* clear the cache

</code></pre>
</div>
<p>watchman watch-del-all</p>

<p>npm start –reset-cache
```</p>
