<h1 id="expo">Expo</h1>

<p><a href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a> is a service for building and serving React Naive apps.  Using Expo, you could release an app without ever opening XCode or Android Studio.  React Native is great, but there’s still a lot of work that goes into testing and releasing for the seperate platforms.</p>

<p>I’m going to assume you know the basics of React-Native. If not, <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html">follow their quick</a> getting started tutorial to get up to speed.</p>

<p>Even cooler, Expo lets you share snippets of React-Native apps, much like JS-Fiddle.</p>
