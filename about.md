### About me
Hello!  I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Tennessee Knoxville and the University of Kentucky.  I am trained as a microbiologist and have slowly evolved as a bioinformaticist and, now, as a mobile/web developer.  

## My current projects

## University of Kentucky

* [Expanding Your Horizons](http://www.bradfordcondon.com/2017/05/14/EYHpress/) women in STEM outreach
* [Next Generation Sequencing Workshop](https://ngs.csr.uky.edu/)

## University of Tennessee

* [TreeSnap mobile web and app developer](https://treesnap.org/)
* [Hardwood Genomics developer](http://hardwoodgenomics.org/)
* [Tripal developer](http://www.tripal.info/)


### This site 
This site exists as a "living CV" for me.  On this site you will find thoughts on science in popular media, snippets of code to help budding bioinformatic scientists, and information on some of the work I'm doing.  This site uses Jekyll and the Bulma CSS framework, and is hosted by github pages.
