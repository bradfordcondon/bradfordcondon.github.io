<p class="message">
Hello!  I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Tennessee Knoxville and the University of Kentucky.  I am trained as a microbiologist and have slowly evolved as a bioinformaticist and, now, as a mobile/web developer.  On this site you will find thoughts on science in popular media, snippets of code to help budding bioinformatic scientists, and information on some of the work I'm doing.

My name is Bradford.  
 

 This site uses Jekyll, hosted by github pages, using the [poole](https://github.com/poole) theme.
