### About me
Hello!  I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Tennessee Knoxville.  I am trained as a microbiologist and have  evolved as a bioinformaticist and, now, as a mobile/web developer.
  
### This site 
This site exists as a "living CV" for me.  You will find my thoughts on science in popular media, snippets of code to help budding bioinformatic scientists, and information on some of the work I'm doing.  This site uses Jekyll and the Bulma CSS framework, and is hosted with github pages.
