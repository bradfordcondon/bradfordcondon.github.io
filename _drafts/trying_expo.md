Today we're going to mess around with Expo.  This assumes you've got some basic knowledge about...

# Expo

[Expo](https://expo.io/) is a service for building and serving React Naive apps.  Using Expo, you could release an app without ever opening XCode or Android Studio.  React Native is great, but there's still a lot of work that goes into testing and releasing for the seperate platforms.

I'm going to assume you know the basics of React-Native. If not, [follow their quick](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html) getting started tutorial to get up to speed.

Even cooler, Expo lets you share snippets of React-Native apps, much like JS-Fiddle.
