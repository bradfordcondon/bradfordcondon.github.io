On April 29th 2017, the Expanding Your Horizons conference came to Kentucky for the first time.  The conference was funded by an NSF EPSCoR (National Science Foundation Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research for Education and Outreach)  grant which I, along with Ellen Crocker and Susan Odom, was a PI on.

## About the conference

>Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) is a conference for girls in middle school and their parents/ guardians. 
This day-long event will include hands-on activities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) for girls and educational sessions for parents/ guardians. At the conference, girls will get a chance to meet STEM role models and learn more about careers in those fields. Our ultimate goal is to motivate girls to become innovative and creative thinkers ready to meet 21st Century challenges.
