I've been hosting my personal blog on Wordpress for several years now.  When I started, I was a computational novice.  Over the years, I've grown more and more proficient with computer science basics.  I've gone from a perl noob to coding in in not just perl but R, javascript, and php. My blog hasn't kept up, and it hasn't documented my journey, in part because adding content, particularly Markdown formatted content, has been kind of a pain.  Not to mention I'm paying for webhosting when I'm serving static pages (see how these blog pages just display text, links, and images?  That means they are static).
No longer.
Today I set up a github pages blog, and I'm going to walk you through how.

#Install Jekyll

First, we're going to install [Jekyll](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html) locally.  Jekyll will be in charge of parsing our markdown.


`curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`


Because we already have ruby installed locally, installing jekyll is as simple as `gem install jekyll`.  If you don't have Ruby and RubyGems, check for instructions and other dependencies [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
