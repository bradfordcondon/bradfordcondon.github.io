 Two mapping populations were established with three Chinese chestnut parents, ‘Mahogany’, ‘Nanking’, and ‘Vanuxem’, totaling 337 progeny. The transcriptome-based genetic map was created with 329 simple sequence repeat and 1,064 single nucleotide polymorphism markers all derived from expressed sequence tag sequences. Genetic maps for each parent were developed and combined to establish 12 consensus linkage groups spanning 742 cM.
