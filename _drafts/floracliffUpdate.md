[I previously announced a Workshop we hosted at Floracliff on mushroom identification](http://www.bradfordcondon.com/fun/science/2016/08/25/upcoming-workshop-mushrooms-101-at-floracliff-nature-conservatory/).  It's been a while but I wanted to share a little bit about the experience and post materials.

First of all, a big thank you to Beverly and Josie at Floracliff.  It was a joy working with you all.  Same goes to our wonderful participants, we couldn't have asked for a better audience.

I'm sharing photos from the workshop and material below. Special thanks to Kevin Lutes for taking professional photographs and for permission to link them here.

Hope to see you all again soon!
