<p>If there’s one thing I wish I’d done earlier in my career, it’s this: automate <em>all</em> of my bioinformatics workflows and keep it under version control.</p>

<p>What does this mean?  Any and every task is done on the command line.  The commands executed are stored in a shell script.  The shell script gets stored (and, linked with GitHub, stored online) and any changes made are tracked.</p>

<p>Here’s the problem: this is hard.  It’s really hard if you aren’t a programmer.  Downloading software, getting it to run, renaming files.  I would cheat with all of this and do it using my operating system’s GUI.  It was faster, I didn’t have to learn new confusing commands like <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl</code> to download things or shell scripting.  I get it.  But, if you can keep your bioinformatics notebook under version control, you will reap the rewards.</p>

<h3 id="rewind">Rewind</h3>
<p>If something worked six months ago, you can rewind your project and it will work again.</p>

<p>What’s more, if your system gets mucked up, you can start from scratch by re-cloning your repo.  You don’t have to track down all the software, all the dependencies, re-download all the raw data, rename it to match your scripts.  You were smart, and you wrote all that as shell scripts.  Now, you just need to re-execute the command and you’ve got your environment set up.  Maybe your computer is fine but you’ve run out of memory or are migrating your workflow to a remote server.  No problem.</p>

<p>GitHub is fantastic for collaborating.  Work on projects without fear of overwriting your coworkers changes.  Once you master branching and merging, each piece of the project you work on will be an isolated feature, and multiple people can contribute to different portions of the project at once.
Collaboration isn’t just about working together.  It’s about distributing your work in a way that others can reproduce it.  Nothing is more reproducible than a project that runs from start to finish by executing a single command.
Graduate school is about learning skills and building a portfolio.  GitHub is the place to showcase that portfolio.</p>
