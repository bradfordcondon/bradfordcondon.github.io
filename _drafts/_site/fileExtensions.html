<p>This post is the first in a series on understanding biological file formats.  This material is developed for use in the KBRIN Next Generation Sequencing workshop 2017 hosted at the University of Kentucky.</p>

<p>Before I get into explaining the specific output of different common programs, I first need to answer a simple question: what is a file format?  Simple questions are often redirected to the dictionary (or in this day and age, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A file format is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. It specifies how bits are used to encode information in a digital storage medium.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="binary">Binary</h3>
<p>These characters are encoded in binary using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII characters rules</a>.</p>

<h3 id="utf">UTF</h3>

<h3 id="fasta">FASTA</h3>

<p>If we’re thinking about bioinformatics data, we are usually thinking about <em>strings</em> which can be written out in a text file.  For example, a protein represented in FASTA format is written out in FASTA format as</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	&gt;SequenceABC heat shock protein
	AALLRALYNKKLAYQ
	&gt;sequence D
	....
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In FASTA format, each new sequence is seperated by a <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> character.  All other characters after the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> until the next line are part of the header.  Everything up until the first space (<code class="highlighter-rouge"> </code>) is the sequence name, and everything after is part of the sequence description.</p>

<p>How does the file describe that the description is over, and the sequence has started?  After all, it’s made up of the same character types- letters.  In fact, there is a special character called the newline character that signifies the line break.  All characters not on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> line are part of the sequence.  This means that Sequence A and sequence B below are identical.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;Sequence A
AAAA
&gt;Sequence B
AA
AA
&gt;Sequenc
e C 
AAAA

</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Sequence C, on the other hand, is actually <code class="highlighter-rouge">sequenc</code> with everything follows as part of the sequence.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fasta and spaces, do they get ignored?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-newline-character">The newline character</h4>

<p>It’s worth taking a break and pointing out that <strong>different file systems use different newline characters</strong>.  A common rookie mistake is to open a file such as a FASTA file in Microsoft Word, do some editing, and save the file.</p>

<p>On Windows, a newline is actually two characters: <code class="highlighter-rouge">/r/n</code>.  On Linux, it is only <code class="highlighter-rouge">/n</code>.  This is only just the beginning: all sorts of extra information is included in a Microsoft word file, such as <strong>bold</strong> characters, fonts, colors, line spacing, etc.  This is why I usually recommend fledgeling bioinformaticists learn to use a basic text editor and never look back.  In writing this article I’ve learned that there are actually plugins for <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-13-124">working with bioinformatics data in Microsoft Word</a>, but the safer route is to learn to work with one of the many, free, basic text editors out there.</p>
