Wow. These reviews are extremely incriminating; reviewers obviously spotted some of the key problems with this paper. &#8220;This paper claims that cells from any somatic tissue can be reprogrammed to a fully pluripotent state by treatment for a few days with weak acid.

This is such an extraordinary claim that a very high level of proof is required to sustain it and I do not think this level has been reached&#8221;
