the current manuscript and reference library in a shared folder. \u00a0No more emailing files back and forth (and, most frustratingly, losing comments or edits as versions are passed back and forth. \u00a0In theory, <a href=\"http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/skydrive\/download\">Microsoft Skydrive<\/a>\u00a0should be the ideal solution for this sort of thing, as it boasts seamless editing of word files as <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/\">google drive<\/a> does. \u00a0Unfortunately for both of these services, I wasn&#8217;t able to get it to seamlessly integrate as well without doing the word processing on the web interface. \u00a0Fun fact: if it doesn&#8217;t work easily for the boss, it isn&#8217;t going to happen.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, collaborators tend to be elsewhere in the world, and while I&#8217;m a night creature, my advisor writes in the morning. \u00a0This means we aren&#8217;t all trying to edit the same Dropbox shared document at once.<\/p>\n<p>Another nice use for papers is syncing my<a href=\"http:\/\/bradfordcondon.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/05\/citation-management-papers\/\"> Papers<\/a> library. \u00a0I wish that Papers had this kind of service automatically, but it&#8217;s a nice work around. \u00a0Keep your papers library on dropbox in a secure location, and you can sync it between macs. \u00a0Just be careful to close down Papers when you are done with it &#8211; otherwise, you&#8217;ll get conflicting libraries.<\/p>\n<p>There are a million other uses for Dropbox, but these are the ones I regularly take advantage of.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":2,"created_at":"Sat, 18 May 2013 21:04:28

make no dietary changes, go on a diet, or go on a diet with a bar of chocolate. \u00a0By only including 15 people\u00a0in their study, and measuring a wealth of factors, they were guaranteed to find that the chocolate\u00a0dieters\u00a0fared better in some way than the other groups. \u00a0The finding would be meaningless, but it would be \u201cstatistically significant\u201d \u2013 within the confines of their prohibitively\u00a0small study. \u00a0They lucked out, and the 5 chocolate eaters lost weight.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_419\" style=\"width:

class=\"wp-caption-text\">How to Lie With Statistics, by Daryl Huff.<\/figcaption><\/figure>Next, they needed to publish their study somewhere. \u00a0Fortunately for Johannes, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to distinguish \u201cfake\u201d publishers from real ones. \u00a0Real journals will conduct real peer review, where third-party scientists must evaluate the article before it can be published. \u00a0Due to the intentionally poor design of this study, it (hopefully) wouldn\u2019t pass peer review in any credible journal.\n\nA fake publisher, on the other hand, will not conduct review. \u00a0Instead, it will collect a publication fee, then immediately accept and publish the article without review. \u00a0Bohannon\u2019s paper was easily accepted into the [International Archives of Medicine](http:\/\/www.intarchmed.com\/)\u00a0without any peer review.\n\nOnce the paper was published, it took off in the science and diet sections of many, many magazines, blogs, and newspapers. \u00a0You can easily understand why- \u201cChocolate helps you lose weight\u201d is the sort of headline The Daily Mail and its ilk dream about.\n\n\n## **The Assignment**\n\nBack to my students. \u00a0To consider a news piece credible, students first needed to ask three questions.\n\n**1. \u00a0Is the finding reported by a scientist? \u00a0Who? \u00a0Does the scientist work for a biased source?**\n\n**2. \u00a0Was the finding published in a peer-reviewed journal?**\n\n**3. \u00a0Can you find the article? \u00a0Do\u00a0the conclusions the authors draw in the abstract reflect what is reported in the newspaper?**\n\nHow would my students fare if they were given this article? \u00a0It turns out, not so well. \u00a0Here are my answers, working from [Bohannon\u2019s press release](http:\/\/instituteofdiet.com\/2015\/03\/29\/international-press-release-slim-by-chocolate\/).\n\n**Question\u00a0****1: \u00a0Is the finding reported by a scientist? \u00a0Does the scientist work for a biased source?**\n\nJohannes Bohannon is presented as the\u00a0research director of the nonprofit Institute of Diet and Health, a fictional institute. \u00a0They have a website that is intentionally minimalist. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t look incredibly legitimate, but it also doesn\u2019t scream crazy. \u00a0I imagine most students would give it a pass, despite the possibility that, say, this fictional institute is funded by Nestle.\n\n**Question 2:****\u00a0 Was the finding published in a peer-reviewed journal?**\n\nYes of course it was! \u00a0Here\u2019s the real problem predatory journals present to the common reader going forward. \u00a0[The International Archives of Medicine](http:\/\/www.intarchmed.com\/)\u00a0(IAM)\u00a0is a legitimate enough sounding journal. \u00a0The Journal\u2019s website has an ISSN, citation metrics, and assurances that it is included in the JournalGuide whitelist of reputable titles. \u00a0As Bohannon reports, this journal\u00a0*used\u00a0*to be reputable, as it was published under[ BioMed Central](http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/), a trustworthy open-access publisher.\n\nIn short, one would need to do some serious digging to realize the journal is bogus.\n\n**Question 3. \u00a0Can you find the article? \u00a0Do\u00a0the conclusions the authors draw in the abstract reflect what is reported in the newspaper?**\n\nYes and yes. \u00a0This is an easy one, because Bohannon\u2019s\u00a0wrote both the press release and the article.\n\n\n## **The solution**\n\nIt\u2019s clear that we have a problem here. \u00a0What prevents someone\u00a0from doing poor work (or fabricating work) and \u201cpublishing\u201d the work in predatory journals? \u00a0Nothing. \u00a0And unless some sort of watchdog agency is set up to accredit peer-reviewed journals, this will not change any time soon. \u00a0If real scientists can\u2019t distinguish a quality journal from a predatory one, what chance do non-scientists have? \u00a0As it is, I find Beall\u2019s [list of questionable publishers](http:\/\/scholarlyoa.com\/publishers\/)\u00a0to be the most useful resource for investigating journals. \u00a0But this is a list built by a science librarian who saw a problem, and can\u2019t be expected to be definitive or exhaustive. \u00a0The JournalGuide, cited\u00a0on IAM\u2019s website, appears to be a reasonable resource in its own right (it\u2019s listed in [this Nature article](http:\/\/www.nature.com\/news\/rate-that-journal-1.17225) on resources for evaluating journals), but obviously it\u2019s not perfect if IAM is listed.\n\nIf policing publishers isn\u2019t the answer, then what can be done? \u00a0Bohannon\u2019s piece makes one thing abundantly clear: the popular media did not do their homework on this piece. \u00a0Many magazines ran the story without contacting Bohannon at all. \u00a0If he was contacted, he was never contacted by someone who knew enough about science to ask the right questions. \u00a0In short, science journalism lack skepticism. \u00a0It seems that most magazines will run an article without asking the three questions I listed above. \u00a0And even if they do, it\u2019s clear that a more\u00a0careful tact must be taken in the future to prevent spreading misinformation.\n\nUntil that day arrives, I urge you, the reader, to bring a healthy dose of skepticism to every new miracle finding you read, especially related to human health, sexuality, and diet. \u00a0Do your homework, because no one else is doing it for you.\n\n\n","html":"<p>When I

reported. \u00a0So they enlist Johannes to conduct\u00a0a shoddy study. \u00a0Participants will either make no dietary changes, go on a diet, or go on a diet with a bar of chocolate. \u00a0By only including 15 people\u00a0in their study, and measuring a wealth of factors, they were guaranteed to find that the chocolate\u00a0dieters\u00a0fared better in some way than the other groups. \u00a0The finding would be meaningless, but it would be &#8220;statistically significant&#8221; &#8211; within the confines of their prohibitively\u00a0small study. \u00a0They lucked out, and the 5 chocolate

class=\"wp-caption-text\">How to Lie With Statistics, by Daryl Huff.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Next, they needed to publish their study somewhere. \u00a0Fortunately for Johannes, it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to distinguish &#8220;fake&#8221; publishers from real ones. \u00a0Real journals will conduct real peer review, where third-party scientists must evaluate the article before it can be published. \u00a0Due to the intentionally poor design of this study, it (hopefully) wouldn&#8217;t pass peer review in any credible journal.<\/p>\n<p>A fake publisher, on the other hand, will not conduct review. \u00a0Instead, it will collect a publication fee, then immediately accept and publish the article without review. \u00a0Bohannon&#8217;s paper was easily accepted into the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.intarchmed.com\/\">International Archives of Medicine<\/a>\u00a0without any peer review.<\/p>\n<p>Once the paper was published, it took off in the science and diet sections of many, many magazines, blogs, and newspapers. \u00a0You can easily understand why- &#8220;Chocolate helps you lose weight&#8221; is the sort of headline The Daily Mail and its ilk dream about.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Assignment<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Back to my students. \u00a0To consider a news piece credible, students first needed to ask three questions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. \u00a0Is the finding reported by a scientist? \u00a0Who? \u00a0Does the scientist work for a biased source?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>2. \u00a0Was the finding published in a peer-reviewed journal?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>3. \u00a0Can you find the article? \u00a0Do\u00a0the conclusions the authors draw in the abstract reflect what is reported in the newspaper?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>How would my students fare if they were given this article? \u00a0It turns out, not so well. \u00a0Here are my answers, working from <a href=\"http:\/\/instituteofdiet.com\/2015\/03\/29\/international-press-release-slim-by-chocolate\/\">Bohannon&#8217;s press release<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Question\u00a0<\/strong><strong>1: \u00a0Is the finding reported by a scientist? \u00a0Does the scientist work for a biased source?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Johannes Bohannon is presented as the\u00a0research director of the nonprofit Institute of Diet and Health, a fictional institute. \u00a0They have a website that is intentionally minimalist. \u00a0It doesn&#8217;t look incredibly legitimate, but it also doesn&#8217;t scream crazy. \u00a0I imagine most students would give it a pass, despite the possibility that, say, this fictional institute is funded by Nestle.<\/p>\n<p><b>Question 2:<\/b><strong>\u00a0 Was the finding published in a peer-reviewed journal?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Yes of course it was! \u00a0Here&#8217;s the real problem predatory journals present to the common reader going forward. \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.intarchmed.com\/\">The International Archives of Medicine<\/a>\u00a0(IAM)\u00a0is a legitimate enough sounding journal. \u00a0The Journal&#8217;s website has an ISSN, citation metrics, and assurances that it is included in the JournalGuide whitelist of reputable titles. \u00a0As Bohannon reports, this journal\u00a0<em>used\u00a0<\/em>to be reputable, as it was published under<a href=\"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/\"> BioMed Central<\/a>, a trustworthy open-access publisher.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In short, one would need to do some serious digging to realize the journal is bogus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Question 3. \u00a0Can you find the article? \u00a0Do\u00a0the conclusions the authors draw in the abstract reflect what is reported in the newspaper?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Yes and yes. \u00a0This is an easy one, because Bohannon&#8217;s\u00a0wrote both the press release and the article.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The solution<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear that we have a problem here. \u00a0What prevents someone\u00a0from doing poor work (or fabricating work) and &#8220;publishing&#8221; the work in predatory journals? \u00a0Nothing. \u00a0And unless some sort of watchdog agency is set up to accredit peer-reviewed journals, this will not change any time soon. \u00a0If real scientists can&#8217;t distinguish a quality journal from a predatory one, what chance do non-scientists have? \u00a0As it is, I find Beall&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/scholarlyoa.com\/publishers\/\">list of questionable publishers<\/a>\u00a0to be the most useful resource for investigating journals. \u00a0But this is a list built by a science librarian who saw a problem, and can&#8217;t be expected to be definitive or exhaustive. \u00a0The JournalGuide, cited\u00a0on IAM&#8217;s website, appears to be a reasonable

Because we&#8217;re working with hundreds, if not thousands, of scaffolds, it&#8217;s necessary to filter out the scaffolds of interest in some way, either by number of SNPs or the specific scaffolds of interest.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We do two quick things to help us out. \u00a0The first is use count() and match() to generate a column which essentially counts the number of SNPs for each scaffold. \u00a0Then we use order() to sort by this new SNP count column.<\/p>\n<pre><code>library(plyr)\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\n\r\nsetwd(\"\/your path\")\r\nsnps&lt;-read.table(\"out.txt\",sep=\"\\t\",header=F)\r\n\r\ncolnames(snps)&lt;-c(\"chr\",\"start\",\"end\")\r\n\r\n#Column of # SNPs\r\ncounts= count(snps[1])\r\nsnps$Count &lt;- counts[[2]][ match( snps$chr, counts[[1]] ) ]\r\n\r\nsnpsorder= snps[order(-snps[,4]),] \r\n\r\nsubset= subset(snpsorder, Count &gt; 40000)\r\n\r\n# Plot SNP density\r\ntoprint&lt;-ggplot(subset) + \r\n  geom_histogram(aes(x=start), binwidth=1000) + # binwidth will effectively set the printing window size.\r\n  facet_wrap(~ chr,ncol=2) + # fiddle with number of columns depending on how many scaffolds you print\r\n  ggtitle(\"SNPs\") +\r\n    xlab(\"nucleotide number\") +   ylab(\"SNP density\") +   theme_bw() \r\n\r\n\r\n# save to .png\r\npng(\"snps.png\",750,750)\r\nprint(toprint)\r\ndev.off()\r\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The above R code will plot the only scaffold with over 40k SNP counts.

href=\"http:\/\/www.wernerlab.org\/software\/macqiime\/macqiime-installation\">Turns out that the developers are aware of this issue, and plan to fix it soon.<\/a> \u00a0For now, they offer the below line of code to execute the MacQIIME\u00a0shell:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint hljs-dark\"><code class=\"hljs gradle\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">source<\/span> <span
