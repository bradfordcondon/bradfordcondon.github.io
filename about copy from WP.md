Hello!  I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Tennessee Knoxville and the University of Kentucky.  I am trained as a microbiologist and have slowly evolved as a bioinformaticist and, now, as a mobile/web developer.  On this site you will find thoughts on science in popular media, snippets of code to help budding bioinformatic scientists, and information on some of the work I&#8217;m doing.

I&#8217;m always interested in projects involving bioinformatics or data science.  If you&#8217;d like to discuss projects, [please contact me.](mailto:bradford.condon@gmail.com)
